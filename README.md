# Tracking water quality over time in the Lower Mekong

Helen Miller

A satellite remote sensing workflow for detecting water quality parameters in the Lower Mekong River basin. 

__Background__: The Mekong River is one of the world's largest rivers, and the Lower Mekong Basin (LMB) feeds an estimated 60 million people daily. Its biodiversity and productivity is driven by seasonal fluctuations in flow driven by the monsoonal climate, known as the flood-pulse. The processes driving productivity are likely changing with the onset of widespread deforestation and hydropower dam development in the last two decades. Remote sensing methods exist for some key indicators of water quality, including chlorophyll (an indicator for phytoplankton abundance) and turbidity. Using the Harmonized Landsat Sentinel dataset, this project will track chlorophyll and turbidity over the last decade in all large mainstem and tributary river reaches in the Lower Mekong Basin. 

__Questions__:  
* How have chlorophyll concentrations and turbidity changed in the last decade across the Lower Mekong Basin?
* Where have any changes occurred? Does it vary across the river network?

__Datasets__: 
* Global Landsat River Reaches
* Annual water extent
* Harmonized Landsat Sentinel
